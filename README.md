Hoot-Wolf-Box
=============

Hoot is a scheduling software that drives Linux-based hardware for broadcasting/recording sounds. It's main purpose originally was to broadcast the sound of a wolf cry and then listen for a short period of time for a reply. This was initially intended to learn about where wolves are located at specific times and how often they are calling each other. This can also be extended to include video for a security system or wildlife observation application. 

The main application is written using C++, Java, and XML, but the graphical user interface is written in C#.

To learn more about the functionality of the application, read the Hootd User Manual, located in Docs > UserManual.
