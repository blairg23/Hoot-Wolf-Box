Hoot-Wolf-Box
=============

Hoot is a scheduling software that drives Linux-based hardware for broadcasting/recording sounds. It's main purpose originally was to broadcast the sound of a wolf cry and then listen for a short period of time for a reply. This was to learn about when / where wolves are located and how they are calling each other.
