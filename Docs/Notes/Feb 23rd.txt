Drew Diagram to figure out missing pieces:
Have (in order):
-Scheduler UI
-Zip folder
	-Contains XML and Sound files
-Zip is in USB key
-When plugged in, runs script (Thomas)
	-Box on
	-Check USB
		-If in: Get schedule/unzip
		-Signal
	-StartScheduler
-Internal Scheduler Application running as a daemon
	-Decompression (Dayton)
	-XML Parser(Gene)
		-Parse to discover next even
		-Set event object
			-Current
			-Next
		-If start time < 5 mins,
			-Delay until start time of current event
			-"Do" Event (play/record)
		-Else
			-Set wake event
			-Sleep


-Talked about killing daemon process
	-Pros/cons
-Final Decision:
	-Check interval
		-If high interval,
			-Power down
		-If low interval,
			-suspend to RAM
-New REQ:
	-If light is on, box is on
		-If on, wait til it powers down first
	-If light is off, box is off
		-Once light is off, safe to plug in USB key, then power back on
		-Once signal goes off, remove USB key
	WARNING: DO NOT LEAVE USB KEY IN AFTER SIGNAL!
