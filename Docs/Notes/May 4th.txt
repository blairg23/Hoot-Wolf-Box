Status:

Can install/uninstall, starts up with USB inserted, needs mic/speakers to startup

If you remove USB peripherals while running, it will error out. If it errors out, user needs to shut down box, reinsert peripherals, then restart box.

To deactivate hoot command line interface, so you can get to GUI:

	- Create a blank text file named "nostart" in main directory of USB key
